Before the 2000s, due to the lack of productivity and low level of hygiene, a significant amount of people died from plagues and infections. When antibiotics, such as penicillin, were found in 2000 century, the fatality rate of plague and infections decreased dramatically. Because of the rapid development of modern medicine, more and more threatening diseases can now be cured. However, every coin has two sides. Technological development and the excess capacity of industry in modern society lead to a lot of new problems such as drug abuse and obesity.
